I'm new here, and I understand that it's improperly to attach works in this way, but pay attention to the "introduction_to_software_testing".

# Unfortunately, I had to create tests for assignments in the online compiler due to problems with the Java environment. Therefore, they are attached separately from the assignments.

Hope for understanding.
