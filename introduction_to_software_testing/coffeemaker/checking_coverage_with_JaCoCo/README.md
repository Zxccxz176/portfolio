# There is a bug into Coursera assignment. Only the test of "Golden" version fits to this assignment. That's why there is a test of "Golden" version.

# Task

You will check and possibly extend your unit test suite to ensure a high level of coverage is achieved using JaCoCo.  

An initial eclipse project is available in the .zip file below.  This project contains a build.gradle file with all of the dependencies necessary to use JaCoCo.  For directions in how to install gradle buildship support into Eclipse, see the "Test Doubles: Installing Gradle and Mockito" lecture.

# Deliverable

Your task is to measure the structural coverage achieved by your unit test suite against each of the domain classes in the CoffeeMaker example: CoffeeMaker, Inventory, Recipe, and RecipeBook using the JaCoCo tool.  Follow the steps from the lecture on JaCoCo to create a gradle build with JaCoCo, and use JaCoCo to measure the coverage of your jUnit tests.  

If you do not achieve full coverage of each class, add (useful!) tests until full coverage is achieved.
