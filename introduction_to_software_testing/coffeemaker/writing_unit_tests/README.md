# Task

In this assignment, you'll get some practice at building effective unit tests on a slightly larger example of a coffee maker.
The coffee maker allows you to set up recipes, add ingredients, and to make one of several beverages, provided that you insert enough money. It is an often-used pedagogical example from our colleague Laurie Williams at NC State university.
A list of the user stories (requirements) and use cases is available at: http://www.realsearchgroup.com/SEMaterials/tutorials/coffee_maker/ 

Also, we have made .pdfs of the use cases, the class diagram, and a scenario for the Coffee Maker in the .zip file below:

# Deliverable

Your task is to create a file, CoffeeMakerTest.java, which properly tests the CoffeeMaker class to ensure it is working properly. A slightly buggy version of the coffee maker is available here. And a "golden" version of the same model, in which all tests should pass is available here:
